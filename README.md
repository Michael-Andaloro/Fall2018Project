# Fall2018Project
This is the Final Project I submitted for my Advanced Discrete Structures.

The code is written in Java.
FinalProject.java is the main file where the majority of the work is done.
There are several supporting files included from other developers, their names are given at the top of those files.

To run the program, please compile all the files in the folder, then run the FinalProject file to begin the program.
There are three main levels, the first is simple while the third is the most complicated.
Each level varies based on the number of edges, the higher the level, the more edges will be there.
The program randomly generates these edges, and connects the edges and assigns a random weight to that line.
The program then finds the minimum weight spanning tree that connects all the edges without any cycles.

If you have any questions, please contact me at mandaloro@udallas.edu.
Thank you
